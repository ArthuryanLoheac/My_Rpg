protagonist|"How did she died ? No one told me."
dyn|"Heart attack, or so I have been told,
but I'll deal with that later"
dyn|"I still have some unfinished buisness
elsewhere."
dyn|"I know it'll get me killed, but it's not
like we aren't all dead anyway, I mean
us 6."
dyn|"You know sometime I just sit down and
reminisce about the good ol' days...; I do, not that
good to me; And what do
you think ?"
